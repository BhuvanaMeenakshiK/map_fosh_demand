## Welcome to the Contributing guidelines

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read through this project and for your interest in collaborating. 

There are several ways to contribute to this project:


**Do you speak another language other than English?** 
Consider translating the survey so that non-English speakers can also share their scientific hardware needs!

- The best way to contribute here is to fork this repo, create the translation and then make a [pull request](https://github.com/amchagas/map_fosh_demand/pulls).



**Do you like playing with data?** 
Take a look at the Jupyter notebook being used to do analysis! This way we can better visualize the data and have a better idea what things are necessary and where.


- The best way to contribute here is to fork this repo, change the code and then make a [pull request](https://github.com/amchagas/map_fosh_demand/pulls).
  
  - Please make sure your code is properly commented and that variable names are as self-explanatory as possible. Keep in mind that people with different backgrounds and coding skill levels are involved! Coding with more simple steps is preferred over complicated "one liners" (even if they are more efficient).



**Do you love hardware development?**
Find a piece of the hardware in the "needed instruments" list and:
- go to the respective repository! There you'll find ways to contribute and what help is needed, since this will change given the development stage of the device.
- If a repository is not there yet, get in touch by [adding an issue](https://github.com/amchagas/map_fosh_demand/issues) to this repo stating what hardware you would like to develop! We will then get in touch and offer as much support as needed to get you going :)



**Would you like to use/test what is being developed?**
Get in touch by [opening up an issue](https://github.com/amchagas/map_fosh_demand/issues), this way we can best support you in building/testing and trouble shooting.
