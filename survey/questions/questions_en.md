# Mapping the demand for research equipment

Description:
This survey was developed as a collaboration between the [Rede de Pesquisadores](https://www.rededepesquisadores.org/), [OpenNeuroscience](www.openeuroscience.com), [Prometheus Science](www.Prometheus-science.com), [Trend in Africa](www.trendinafrica.org), and the [Mozilla Foundation](www.mozilla.org).

#### Welcome message:
Our goal is to identify what are the current demands and needs related to scientific equipment used by researchers/DIYers/curious people in their projects.

Your participation will enable us to develop a series of online tutorials related to building affordable equipment.
It will also help us identify opportunities for the creation of equipment distributed under open/permissive licenses.
Under these types of licenses, the created equipment can be used, modified, copied, and improved for new use cases.

It should take less then 10 minutes to complete this questionnaire.
By participating in this survey, you can opt-in to a lottery for one of two books related to science and open source hardware.

Any personal data collected will be kept private and won’t be passed on to third parties.


After data collection is completed, all answers that do NOT allow personal identification of respondents will be openly available on GitHub.
We believe sharing this information is the best way to empower others and enable them to develop their tools for the public good.

As an incentive to complete this survey, we have a book prize! You'll have the chance to choose between 2 titles related to Open source hardware. The way to participate is to complete the survey and answer the final 2 questions related to the prize itself.

#### Open Technologies (Open Source)
 The open source movement is based on the idea that all the blueprints for software, hardware, equipment as well as articles and protocols can and should be freely distributed for use, study, customization and improvement. This movement started around the sixties and gained a lot of space with the development of the Internet. Examples include the web browser firefox, and the GNU/Linux operating system.
