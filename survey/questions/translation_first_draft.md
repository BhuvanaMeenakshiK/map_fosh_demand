# Mapping the demand for research equipment

This survey was developed as a collaboration between the [Rede de Pesquisadores](https://www.rededepesquisadores.org/), [OpenNeuroscience](www.openeuroscience.com), [Prometheus Science](www.Prometheus-science.com), [Trend in Africa](www.trendinafrica.org), and the [Mozilla Foundation](www.mozilla.org).

Our goal is to identify what are the current demands and needs related to scientific equipment used by researchers/DIYers/curious people in their projects.

Your participation will enable us to develop a series of online tutorials related to building affordable equipment.
It will also help us identify opportunities for the creation of equipment distributed under open/permissive licenses.
Under these types of licenses, the created equipment can be used, modified, copied, and improved for new use cases.

It should take less then 10 minutes to complete this questionnaire.
By participating in this survey, you can optionally opt-in to a lottery for one of two books related to science and open source hardware.

Any personal data collected will be kept private and won’t be passed on to third parties.

We appreciate your contribution to improving access to scientific equipment!

After data collection is completed, all answers that do NOT allow personal identification of respondants will be openly available on GitHub.
We believe sharing this information is the best way to empower others and enable them to develop their tools for the public good.

As an incentive to complete this survey, we have a book prize! You'll have the chance to choose between 2 titles related to Open source hardware. The way to participate is to complete the survey and answer the final 2 questions related to the prize itself.

### Open Technologies (Open Source):
The open source movement is based on the idea that all the blueprints for software, hardware, equipment as well as articles and protocols can and should be freely distributed for use, study,  customization and improvement. This movement started around the sixties and gained a lot of space with the development of the Internet. Examples include the web browser firefox, and the GNU/Linux operating system.

Other: ___

-------------------------
##### If your funds were not a constrain and you could buy a new research equipment today, what would it be 
##### (please separate each item with commas eg geiger counter, centrifuge)?
Short answer

-------------------------
##### Would you consider buying equipment from new brands or building it yourself?
-Yes
-no
-maybe:____

---------------------
##### Have you ever tested equipment from less know/new brands, built something yourself?
-Yes:___ 
-no

----------------------------
### Laboratory equipment:

##### In case you have already tested, built equipment yourself, you did it because:
-Only available brand

-Looking for affordable option

-Just to try out new things

-Brand was recommended by a colleague

-Needed to establish new protocols/experiments
in the lab for which there were no options available in the market
