Mapping the demand for research equipment

This survey was developed as a collaboration between the [Rede de Pesquisadores](https://www.rededepesquisadores.org/), [OpenNeuroscience](www.openeuroscience.com), [Prometheus Science](www.Prometheus-science.com), [Trend in Africa](www.trendinafrica.org), and the [Mozilla Foundation](www.mozilla.org).

Our goal is to identify what are the current demands and needs related to scientific equipment used by researchers/DIYers/curious people in their projects.

Your participation will enable us to develop a series of online tutorials and mentorships related to building affordable equipment. It will also help us identify opportunities for the creation of equipment distributed under open/permissive licenses. Under these types of licenses each and everyone of us can use, modify, copy, and improve the created equipment for their desired uses

It should take less then 10 minutes to complete this questionnaire, and by filling it out you can opt-in to participate in a lottery for one of two books related to science and open source hardware. Your personal data will be kept private and won’t be passed on to third parties.

We appreciate your collaboration!

The results of this survey (minus personal information) will be openly available on GitHub, as we believe sharing this information is the best way to empower others and enable them to develop their tools for the public good.

### Open Technologies (Open Source):
The open source movement is based on the idea that all the blueprints for software, hardware, equipment as well as articles and protocols can and should be freely distributed for use, study,  customization and improvement. This movement started around the sixties and gained a lot of space with the development of the Internet. Examples include the web browser firefox, and the GNU/Linux operating system.

##### In case you have already tested, built equipment yourself, you did it because:
-Only available brand

-Looking for affordable option

Just to try out new things

Brand was recommended by a colleague

Needed to establish new protocols/experiments
in the lab for which there were no options available in the market

--------------------------
##### Would you like to test research equipment from new brands or distributed under DIY paradigm?
Yes

no
